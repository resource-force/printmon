      <h1>About AB Printing</h1>

      <p>
        AB Printing tracks the daily printing and copying amounts of
        Acton-Boxborough Regional High School.
      </p>

      <h2>How do you track printing?</h2>

      <p>
        The school EdTech department has, for the past several years, tracked
        printing and copying activity anonymously using a software called
        LaserWatch. This data was pulled in and analyzed to get the real-time
        statistics as shown on the home page.
